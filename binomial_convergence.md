# Binomial Distirbution Convergence to Normal in the Large *N* Limit

## Theory

The proof presented here demonstrates that for a binomial probability distribution function, *B(n,p)*, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success, that as n increases towards infinity, the distribution converges towards a normal probability distribution. The goal of this presentation is to test this theory using random number generators and data visualization.

## Method

For this presentation, Python and packages (numpy, matplotlib) will be utilized.
